HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT:


1. Download the following files from the zip folder:
	Pass1Visitor.h
	Pass1Visitor.cpp
	Pass2Visitor.h
	Pass2Visitor.cpp
	Cpas.g4
	Main.cpp
	sample.expr

Since some files/classes are also imported from pascal, you would require the WCI folder to run them.

2. Now create a C++ project using an IDE (eclipse preferred) and copy all the files mentioned above into that folder.
Download and link all the associated ANTLR/Boost files and runtime libraries into the project.

3. In order to generate the ANTLR files for Cpas.g4, run configurations and change the language to C++ and build the project. After running, ANTLR should automatically generate the required C++ files to run Cpas.

4. Once done, the project is finally ready to run the .expr files that generate the .j code. 

5. Once you have the .j file generated, you can run it in your terminal to create the java class and eventually see the output of the sample expression source files.

6.
ASSEMBLING:

java -jar /your/path/to/jasmin.jar Cpas.j

This should create a class named Cpas.class.

TO EXECUTE the sample program onto the Java Virtual Machine:

Mac and Linux:   java -cp .:/your/path/to/PascalRTL.jar Cpas
Windows:         java -cp .;/your/path/to/PascalRTL.jar Cpas


The display should now be on the terminal screen with the expected outputs as well as the execution time.
